        <p><a href="./about.html">When I started working in the jewelry industry</a>,
            I asked one of my coworkers how the prices of diamonds were set before brands bought them.
            She said that prices are set and weekly updated in a document called the Rapaport Diamond Report.
            The problem is that you need to be a subscriber in order to access it, and I don’t want to do that.
            So instead, how about we look at the prices and corresponding characteristics of some diamonds
            and create a model so we are able to determine the prices ourselves?</p>
        
        <p>Before we start, a quick note:
            the price of a diamond is mainly derived from what are commonly known as the 4C: Cut, Clarity, Carat, Color.
            You can find more information on the <a href = "https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor">website of
            the Gemmological Institute of America.</a></p>
        
        <p>For this reason, I decided that these are the inputs we are going to use to determine the prices in our model.
            The reason is that if we came across a diamond that we wanted to estimate,
            it would be pretty hard to get all of the other measurements that we have in this dataset.
            <br>With that in mind, let’s begin and look at what we have here:</p>
        
        <p>First off, good news: we have no empty lines, which is going to make our task easier.
            However, we see that the prices cover a huge range
            going from $326 to $18,823 but with a median price at $2,401.
            This means that we can expect our model to be much more efficient for lower priced diamonds
            than more expensive ones since it will have had many more examples to train on. Let's check out the distribution of prices visually.</p>

        <p>Looking at the distribution of the weight in carats of the diamonds in our dataset, it seems clear that our prices are correlated
            to the weight of the diamonds, which feels like it makes sense, even without knowing much about diamonds.</p>

        <p>Let's start transforming our dataset so we can work with it.
            First, we will map the characteristics that we decided we would use as inputs. As we said earlier, these would be the 4C.
            Carat is a numerical value, so we will let it be for now.
            Clarity, Color and Cut, however, are strings. If we look at that GIA document,we will learn the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clarity is noted on a scale from IF (being the best, “Internally Flawless”) to I3 (being the worst, “Included”;</li>
            <li>Color is noted on a scale from D (being the best) to Z;</li>
            <li>Cut, according to GIA is noted from Excellent to Poor. Here, we find “Premium” and “Ideal”.
                It does not really fit here, so let’s assume here that “Premium” is better than “Very Good” and that “Ideal” is the best;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Okay, now that we have done that, let's drop the original columns as well as the ones we decided earlier were not
            going to be useful for us.</p>
        
        <p>Now that we have a clean dataset, let's save our inputs in a variable and our target prices in another</p>

        <p>We have several ways to create our model. We could do a multiple linear regression, but it might be a bit simplistic, 
            so let's see what a neural network could do for us.</p>

        <p>Let's split our data into three: train, validation and test, and standardize our inputs</p>

        <p>We are ready to build our neural network. I have experiemented with different versions, number of layers, optimizers, etc.
            This is one version that returns a good result.</p>

        <p>We plot our losses to make sure there was no overfitting.</p>

        <p>And now let's plot our predictions on our test data against the actual targets. If we get something close to a 45° line, it means
            that our model performed well.</p>

        <p>Looks pretty good, doesn't it? Just to confirm, let's get a metric value on how we did, like a root mean square error.</p>

        <p>We get a value of around $600. What does that mean? It means that on average, our model is able to make predictions that will be
            within $600 of the actual price. (as a comparison, I ran a multiple linear regression model on the same dataset which returned
            a root mean square error of $1,224, more than double what we have!</p>

        <p>Is it good? Well, I would argue that given our dataset, it is actually a pretty good result. Remember that 75% of our diamonds
            were $5,324 or less, but that our maximum value was almost $19,000! Yet, despite of that our model is still able to predict credible prices even for bigger gems.</p>

        <p>Let's look at a couple of examples:</p>

        <p>And there it is! This works pretty well for diamonds that are 1 or 1.5 carat maximum.
            However, if we wanted to really accurately predict prices for really big diamonds, we would first need to update our model
            with a bigger sample that would give us a better view of what is happening for these.</p>

        <p>Underneath, you will find a fun tool that will allow you to make your own predictions extremely easily:</p>
