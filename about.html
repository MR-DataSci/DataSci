            <p>Matthieu Rasset is a data scientist from Paris, France. </p>
                
            <p>Matthieu grew up constantly engaged in conversations about numbers, science,
                and “how things work” on both analytical and intellectual levels. </p>
            
            <p>After receiving his Masters degree in Business and spending two years in China,
                Matthieu developed a career driven by his deep passion for watches
                and their intricate mechanics. During his seven year career in horology, jewelry, and luxury sales, Matthieu’s curiosity to understand
                not just the objects at hand,
                but the values and predictive sales patterns behind them, led him to develop a career in data science. </p>
            
            <p>Today, Matthieu fuses his international business background together with superior technical skills and an analytical mindset to create powerful predictive models and analyses that are not only practical, but are also highly communicative--presented
                through engaging narratives with appealing visualizations that effectively convey his research. </p>
            
            <p>Bilingual in French and English with proficiency in Chinese and Japanese, Matthieu’s alacrity
                for language is also present in his digital capacities, having taught himself coding
                in order to enhance his data research and help develop businesses further.
                <br>He is proficient in SQL, Python (numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow), JavaScript, and Tableau.</p>

            <p>Matthieu holds a Masters of Business and a Bachelors in International Business from the University of Le Havre.
                His interests include playing chess, the New York Times Crosswords, vintage watches, and good whisky.</p>
            
            <p>You can find examples of his work <a href="analyses.html">here</a>.</p>
