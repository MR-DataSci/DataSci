            <p>Matthieu Rasset is a data scientist from Paris, France. 
                <br>After graduating in International Business and spending a year and a half in China,
                he started working as a sales associate in the luxury industry.</p>
            
            <p>After a few years specializing in watches and jewelry, Matthieu turned his attention to data science.
                He uses his business background and experience together with his analytical mind and technical skills to create not only powerful predictive models and analyses with appealing visualizations,
                but also to conceive engaging narratives in order to effectively convey his message and findings.</p>
            
            <p>He is proficient in SQL, Python (numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow,...) and Tableau.
                <br>You can find examples of his work <a href="analyses.html">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>He enjoys arguing about movies, doing the New York Times Crosswords (and pretending he can finish the Saturday ones), and vintage watches.
                He also favors a good whisky over a game of chess.</p>
